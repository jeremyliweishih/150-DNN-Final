# 150DNN Final Project: comparison of Bayesian CNNs using BBB, Dropout, and a vanilla CNN.
Please refer to our projecr proposal for more details.

- [x] *Regular CNN Implementation*
- [x] *BBB CNN Implementation*
- [x] Dropout CNN Implementation
- [x] Run Experiments

# Issues:
# -[ ] PREDICTED CLASS LABEL FOR MODELS ARE INCORRECT (they should be in alphabetical order of the classes instead of the order defined in the classes array)

- [x] *NaN in BBB source code when sampling: either fix source code, roll-back, or self-implement (https://github.com/kumar-shridhar/PyTorch-BayesianCNN/issues/8)*

*Italics = in progress*
